I'm ba-ack~ Wow, shiny cake beau! You've really been studying up on your Common to get all those ingredients right, haven't you?

Oh! You...'ve been baking! That looks... like you really put some effort in.

P
Well, it didn't go exactly as planned...

N
[snort] I can tell! Had some trouble reading the Common on those ingredient labels, huh?

P
Yeah I know, I'm learning, I'm learning.

N
Well, I guess it's worth a taste, at least. Go fire up the VR rig, I'll cut us some slices.

P
On it.
